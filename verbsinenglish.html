                <h1>Adding ED to the Verbs</h1>
                <div style="border: magenta te">
            <p>Regular verbs in English (regular verbs) are those to which you only have to add -ed or -d 
                at the end of the infinitive form, or base form, to obtain the conjugation forms
                 of the past and past participle. 
                 For example, play is a regular verb because its preterite and past participle forms are as 
                 follows:</p>
                 <p>Past of the verb play: played (jugue)

                    Past participle of the verb play: played (played).
                    
                    Although this rule applies to all regular verbs, 
                    there are some exceptions subject to certain aspects that you can find below.</p>
                    <h2>1. Adding -d or -ed to the infinitive form</h2>
                    <p>How do you know when to add –d and when to add –ed to a verb?

                        Verbs that only have -d added to the end are those that end in e. For example:
                        
                        Infinitive form: Smile
                        
                        Past tense form: Smiled
                        
                        Past participle form: Smiled.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, verbs that end in a consonant are added –ed. For example:

                            Infinitive form: Open (to open)
                            
                            Past tense form: Opened
                            
                            Past participle form: Opened</p>
                            <h2>If the verb consists of only one syllable and the order of the sounds
                                 is consonant + vowel + consonant, then the last consonant is doubled and –ed is added</h2>
                                </div>
