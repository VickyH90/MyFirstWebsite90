        <h1>Verbs in Third Person/ Simple Present Tense</h1>
       <b> <p style="border: rgb(215, 215, 250); color: blue; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            In English grammar, the third-person singular verb ending is the suffix -s or -es that's conventionally added 
            to the base form of a verb in the present tense when it follows a singular subject in the third person 
            (for example, "She waits and watches").
            Most verbs in English form the third-person singular by adding -s to the base form (sings, gives, requires).
        </p> </b>
        <h1>Verbs ending in -ch, -s, -sh, -x, or -z</h1>
        <b><p style="border: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;">
            form the third-person singular by adding -es (watches, misses, rushes, mixes, buzzes).</p>
        <h1>Verbs ending in a consonant + y</h1>
        <p style="border: aquamarine; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: blue;"> 
            (such as try) form the third-person singular by changing the y to i and adding -es (tries).
            When the verb ends in vocal + y, it does not change the y letter and just add "s" at the end.
        </p> </b>
        <h2>Irregular Verbs in third Person</h2>
        <b><p style="border: blueviolet; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;"> 
            four other English verbs are irregular in the simple present. Three of these irregular, or anomalous, 
            verbs experience consonant changes, vowel changes, or spelling changes in the third person singular form.

            Anomalous verbs are verbs whose conjugation schemes differ significantly from both regular and irregular verbs.
